The <b>Sanctuary of the Madonna della Pioggia </b>, whose full name
is <b>Church of Santa Maria della Pioggia and San Bartolomeo di Reno,
</b>is located at the intersection of <b>Via Galliera </b>and <b>Via
Riva di Reno </b>in Bologna.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Here are some key
information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Origin:
	</b>It was originally known as <b>the Church of San Bartolomeo di
	Reno </b>and dates back to the 13th century as an Oratory.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Name: </b>The
	nickname &quot;Madonna della Pioggia&quot; (Our Lady of the Rain)
	derives from an event in 1561, when a procession carrying the statue
	of the Madonna was associated with the end of a severe drought that
	had struck Bologna, bringing beneficial rains. Following this
	miraculous event, it was dedicated to the Saint and the Madonna.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Structure
	and Works: </b>The church, which has undergone several renovations
	over the centuries, features a façade preceded by a portico with
	three arches. It houses works of art by artists such as Agostino
	Carracci, Francesco Monti, Ludovico Mattioli (his fresco <i>Landscape
	with Saint Bartholomew </i>is located on the eighteenth-century
	staircase leading to the oratory), and a terracotta sculpture by
	Alfonso Lombardi ( <i>Saint Bartholomew </i>).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Interior:
	</b>The interior has a single nave with three side chapels and
	features a frescoed barrel vault.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Statue:
	</b>It houses the 13th-century statue of the <b>Madonna della
	Provvidenza </b>(also known as the Madonna della Pioggia), placed to
	the left of the main altar and donated in 1435 by the Bolognese
	Senate.</p></li>

<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">History:</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The church,
originally dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, houses a painting of the
Madonna and Child, attributed to the 15th-century Bolognese painter
Michele di Matteo. The panel has been considered miraculous since its
discovery; in fact, it was found completely intact under the rubble
of a building destroyed by fire. Other miracles are attributed to the
panel, such as restoring sight to a blind man and helping the people
of Bologna during a long drought in the 16th century (hence the
dedication to the Madonna della Pioggia).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Sanctuary:</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Initially (1449)
the miraculous image was placed on the first floor of the oratory. A
few centuries later (1732) the church was rebuilt and the painting
was placed in the niche above the altar. In the same year the
procession was celebrated and was attended by Cardinal Lambertini,
the future Pope Benedict XIV.</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The building's
façade features a tall colonnaded portico. The interior has a single
nave covered by a barrel vault decorated with frescoes, and four
modest-sized chapels on the sides. The decorations , which adorn both
the chapels and the main altar, are the result of the 1929-31
restoration.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The first chapel
on the left houses a painting by the Bolognese painter and engraver
Agostino Carracci, depicting the Adoration of the Shepherds.
Unfortunately, the work was damaged in a fire during World War II. In
the opposite chapel, there is a 16th-century painting attributed to
Lorenzo Sabbatini depicting the Madonna and Child Enthroned between
Saints Catherine and Lucy.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Sanctuary
also houses the nursing robe that belonged to Saint Camillus de
Lellis, who founded the Camillian Order in 1575. To the left of the
main altar is the 13th-century statue of Our Lady of Providence, also
known as Our Lady of the Serraglio.</p>
