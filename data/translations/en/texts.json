This street disappeared following of the urban planning interventions of the 1930s that led to the creation of Via Guglielmo Marconi (then Via Roma). The Pugliole di San Bernardino took their name from the Monastery or Convent of San Bernardino, which was located in the area of the current Piazza dei Martiri from 1943 to 1945. The street branched off from Borgo Polese (now Via Polese) and wound its way to Via del Porto, partly following the current route of Via Marconi. The term Pugliola (or, in the plural, Pugliole) is an ancient term in Bolognese toponymy. It refers to an alley, a small street, or a small group of houses. Generally, it indicated a small street or a secondary residential area, often deriving from an ancient subdivision of the urban fabric. Many streets and alleys in Bologna, such as Pugliole di San Bernardino or Pugliole dello Spirito Santo, took their names from churches or monasteries that were located nearby, combining the name of the religious institution with the name of the church. Pugliola is a term used to indicate the adjacent alley. In short, Pugliola is a dialectal and historical term meaning alley or street.",
