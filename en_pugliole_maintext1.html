There was a street in Bologna called <b>Pugliole di San Bernardino </b>.
This street disappeared following the urban planning interventions of
the 1930s which led to the creation of Via Guglielmo Marconi (then
Via Roma).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The &quot;
Pugliole di San Bernardino&quot; took their name from the Monastery
or Convent of San Bernardino which was located in the area of the
current Piazza dei Martiri 1943-1945. The street branched off from
Borgo Polese (the current Via Polese) and wound its way up to Via del
Porto, partly following the current route of Via Marconi.</p>

&quot;Pugliola&quot; (or, in the plural, &quot; Pugliole &quot;) is
an ancient term in Bolognese toponymy . It refers to an alley, a
small street, or a small group of houses . It generally indicated a
small road or a secondary residential area, often resulting from an
ancient subdivision of the urban fabric.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Many streets and
alleys in Bologna, such as &quot; Pugliole di San Bernardino&quot; or
&quot; Pugliole dello Spirito Santo,&quot; took their names from
churches or monasteries that were located nearby, combining the name
of the religious institution with the term &quot; pugliola &quot; to
indicate the adjacent alley.</p>
