<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Both works are
considered fundamental examples of genre painting (scenes of everyday
life) in late sixteenth-century Italian art.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Carracci:
The Fathers of the Baroque in Bologna</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis
were a family of Bolognese artists composed of three central figures:
<b>Ludovico Carracci </b>(1555–1619), his cousin <b>Agostino
Carracci </b>(1557–1602), and Agostino's brother, <b>Annibale
Carracci </b>(1560–1609).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Their work and
artistic philosophy are considered the foundation of Baroque
painting, as they proposed a stylistic &quot;reform&quot; that
overcame the artificiality of Mannerism to return to a vigorous
naturalism and a revival of the great classical models of the
Renaissance (such as Raphael and Titian).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1. The
Foundation of the Academy of the Incamminati</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis'
most revolutionary contribution was the foundation in Bologna, around
1582, of a private school that took the name of <b>Accademia dei
Desiderosi </b>, later renamed <b>Accademia degli Incamminati </b>(that
is, &quot;those who are on the right path of art&quot;).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This academy is
considered the first modern art institution in Italy for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Study of
	Life: </b>He encouraged the direct study of nature and the human
	body (the &quot;Life Drawing&quot;), breaking with the Mannerist
	practice of copying only the models of previous masters.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Complete
	Education : </b>In addition to drawing and painting, the Academy
	offered lessons in anatomy, geometry, perspective, and literature,
	elevating the artist from a mere craftsman to a complete
	intellectual.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Stylistic
	Summary : </b>The Carraccis taught how to combine the rigorous
	<b>drawing </b>of the Tuscan-Roman tradition (Michelangelo, Raphael)
	with the <b>colour </b>and use of light typical of the Venetian
	school (Titian, Correggio).</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>2. The Main
Works</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The three
Carraccis worked closely together for many years, often making it
difficult to distinguish individual hands in the early fresco cycles
in Bologna:</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Bologna Period
(Collaboration)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Palazzo
	Fava, Bologna </b>(1584): Frescoes with the <i>Stories of Jason and
	Medea </i>and the <i>Stories of Aeneas </i>.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Palazzo
	Magnani, Bologna </b>(1589-1592): The famous frieze depicting the
	<i>Foundation of Rome </i>, a masterpiece of narrative clarity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Maturity in
Rome (Hannibal)</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In 1595, Annibale
and Agostino were summoned to Rome by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese.
Annibale in particular produced the work that would become the
manifesto of Baroque classicism:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Farnese
	Gallery , Rome </b>(1597-1601): The frescoes depicting <i>The Loves
	of the Gods </i>. This cycle is considered a masterpiece of
	monumental fresco painting and was a point of reference for entire
	generations of subsequent artists, including Lanfranco and Pietro da
	Cortona.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>3. The Three
Artists</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Annibale
	Carracci (1560-1609): </b>The most gifted and innovative of the
	trio. He excelled in both large-scale mythological frescoes (as in
	the Palazzo Farnese) and genre painting (such as <i>The Bean Eater
	</i>), displaying a realism and sensitivity to everyday life that
	anticipated the work of Caravaggio. He is buried in the Pantheon
	next to Raphael.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Ludovico
	Carracci (1555-1619): </b>The eldest and the intellectual and
	theoretical leader of the group. He remained mainly in Bologna,
	focusing primarily on religious works of the Counter-Reformation,
	characterized by profound devotion and emotional intensity.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Agostino
	Carracci (1557-1602): </b>A versatile artist, also known as an
	engraver and theorist. He collaborated actively with his brother and
	cousin, contributing significantly to the decorations of Bologna and
	Rome.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>

<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This house was
already owned by Giovanni Maria Carracci in 1563, who, coming from
Cremona, had opened a <i><b>butcher 's shop in Bologna </b></i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Carracci was the
founder of the Carracci family, which produced two generations of
painters who lived and opened workshops in this very building for
over half a century.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The emotional
bond that the Carraccis had for this home of theirs is demonstrated
by the fact that, even when fame took them to work elsewhere, this
place remained a point of reference to which they always returned.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">On 14 December
1619, in this palace where he was born and which still belonged to
Paolo Carracci, son of Vincenzo, also known as a painter, Ludovico,
the most famous artist of the family, died whose remains were later
buried in the church of S. Maria Maggiore di Galliera.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Over the
centuries, the factory underwent heavy renovations and only recently
underwent a renovation that erased all the damage suffered during the
war. These works have brought to light precious traces of the
building's past.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The portal has a
splayed lintel and its width, given the characteristics of the
street, is still unusual.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The double door
is made of solid wood. It is a fine example of cabinetmaking and
originally had a pedestrian door, which has now been fixed and
concealed with moldings. The handles are polished brass.</p>

<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🥩 <b>Meaning
of &quot;Beccaro&quot;</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">&quot;Beccaro&quot;
is a term of ancient dialectal origin (especially <b>Lombard </b>and
<b>Northern Italian </b>) which means:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Butcher
	</b>(the most common meaning).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Butcher
	</b>(synonym of butcher, although it sometimes indicated the breeder
	of cattle destined for slaughter).</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In short, it
indicated the person who slaughtered animals or sold meat for a
living.</p>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🌎 <b>Origin
and Etymology</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The origin of the
word &quot; beccaro &quot; is of a <b>professional nature </b>and is
linked to the trade described above.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">It derives
	from the word <b>&quot;becco&quot; </b>which, in Latin ( <i>beccus
	</i>), can mean &quot;beak&quot; (of the bird), but in the butcher's
	context refers to the <b>male goat </b>or, more generally, to
	cattle.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">One of the
	most popular hypotheses is that the term is linked to the meat of
	<b>goat </b>(beak) or farmyard animals, which was very popular in
	the Middle Ages.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The form <b>&quot;
	beccaro &quot; </b>is considered the ancestor or dialectal form
	(ancient or regional) of the modern Italian <b>&quot;beccaio&quot; .</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This term, like
many medieval trade names, is at the origin of numerous Italian
surnames such as <b>Beccari </b>, <b>Beccaro </b>and the illustrious
<b>Beccaria </b>(for example, Cesare Beccaria, the author of <i>Dei
delitti e delle pene </i>).</p>
