<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Via <b>Riva di
Reno </b>in Bologna covers the underground route of the <b>Reno Canal
</b>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Here are some
important details:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Reno
	Canal: </b>One of Bologna's main man-made canals, it originates from
	the Reno River near the Casalecchio Lock. This canal has been vital
	to the city's economy since the Middle Ages, powering mills, silk
	mills, and other industrial activities.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	Covering: </b>The canal in that section (and in much of the historic
	center) was progressively covered, or &quot;tombato&quot;, starting
	from the mid-twentieth century for traffic and urban redevelopment
	needs, thus creating space for the current road.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Name:
	</b>The name of the street itself (&quot;Riva di Reno&quot;) recalls
	its original function as the bank or shore of the canal.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Current
	Curiosity: </b>In recent years, during the works for the new tram
	line, the rediscovery of some short stretches of the Reno Canal has
	been discussed and is in part being realised</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The road covers
the route of what was once an important open-air waterway.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">From the
14th-century walls surrounding the city , at Via Sabotino, we find
the Grada Church, which covers the Reno Canal. The grate that once
served to stop floating objects entering the city from the canal can
still be seen today. The bodies of people who drowned in the canal
have also been found.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Continuing from
Via della Grada to the intersection with Via San Felice, the road
takes the name of Via di Riva Reno and ends in Piazza della Pioggia,</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">When walking
along Via di Riva Reno, you arrive near the Piazzetta della Pioggia,
at the height of Via Galliera and if you look up at the buildings,
you will see that they are separated by the presence of the canal,
while at the height of the street there is the portico with the
Pioggia butcher's shop which belonged to the Carracci family, in
particular to Ludovico's father, who was a butcher.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis
played a key role in the history of art, marking the transition from
Mannerism to Baroque and founding the famous Bolognese school of
painting.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis had
an enormous impact, not only for their painting, but also for having
created an educational model (the Academy) that trained the major
artists of seventeenth-century Bologna, such as Guido Reni and
Domenichino.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carracci
family, active in Bologna between the late 16th and early 17th
centuries, are crucial figures in the history of Italian art, as they
marked the transition from <b>Mannerism </b>to <b>Baroque </b>and
founded the famous Bolognese school of painting.</p>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🎨 <b>The
Protagonists: The Carracci Cousins</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The group was
composed of three artists, linked by family ties and a revolutionary
artistic vision:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Ludovico
	Carracci </b>(1555–1619): The elder cousin, considered the
	initiator of the artistic reform and the spiritual leader of the
	group.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Agostino
	Carracci </b>(1557–1602): Brother of Annibale, he excelled as <b>an
	engraver </b>as well as a painter, and was the most erudite
	theoretician of the group.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Annibale
	Carracci </b>(1560–1609): Considered the most talented of the
	three, he was a versatile master, excelling in every pictorial
	genre.</p></li>
</ol>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🏛️ <b>The
Academy of the Incamminati</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The most
innovative contribution of the Carraccis was not only their painting,
but the foundation, around <b>1582 </b>, of an artistic workshop that
later became known as <b>the Accademia degli Incamminati </b>(or
<i>Accademia del Naturale </i>or <i>dei Desiderosi </i>).</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Purpose:
	</b>To overcome the formal excesses and artificiality of Mannerism.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Teaching
	Method: </b>The Academy introduced a modern teaching method based
	on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Life
		study </b>( drawing of nude models and anatomy).</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Copying the
		<b>great masters </b>of the Renaissance (such as Raphael, Titian
		and Correggio).</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Discussions
		of art theory, literature, and poetry.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Legacy:
	</b>They trained the major artists of the seventeenth-century
	Bolognese school, including <b>Guido Reni </b>and <b>Domenichino </b>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🖼️ <b>The
Artistic Reform and Style</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis
advocated a &quot;return to nature&quot; and a <b>clearer, more
emotional and accessible painting </b>, anticipating the principles
of Counter-Reformation art.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Historical
	and Religious Painting: </b>Their religious and mythological works
	are characterized by a strong <b>naturalism </b>and a composition
	that combines the balance of the classical tradition (Raphael) with
	the <b>colorism </b>and sensitivity of Venetian light (Titian and
	Correggio).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Frescoes
	of Palazzo Farnese (Rome): </b>Annibale Carracci's masterpiece (with
	the help of Agostino) was the decoration of the <b>Galleria Farnese
	</b>in Rome (1597-1608), which became the model for Roman Baroque
	painting and the mythological fresco of the following centuries.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Genre
	Painting: </b>Annibale Carracci was also a pioneer in <b>genre
	painting </b>, elevating scenes of everyday life (such as <i>The
	Bean Eater </i>or the two versions of <i>The Butcher's Shop </i>) to
	subjects of great artistic dignity through a careful realism free
	from excessive idealization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The famous work
known as <b>&quot;The Butcher's Shop&quot; </b>was painted by
<b>Annibale Carracci </b>(1560–1609).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">It is one of his
most important <b>genre paintings </b>, that is, scenes depicting
moments of everyday life. This work in particular is remarkable
because, despite depicting a humble subject, it does so with great
dignity, realism, and a complex, monumental composition.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Annibale is cited
as an artist who also excelled in genre painting, citing <i>The Bean
Eater </i>as an example of this realism. &quot;The Butcher's Shop&quot;
is another splendid example of this sensibility.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">It is a bit of a
mystery, since the circumstances of its construction, dated around
<b>1585 , are not known with certainty </b>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">There are several
hypotheses about the clients:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Canobi
	Family : </b>One hypothesis is that the work was intended for a
	well-known Bolognese family of wealthy meat traders, the <b>Canobi </b>,
	owners of a large butcher's shop in the city. However, archival
	research has not provided definitive proof.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Butchers'
	Guild: </b>Another theory is that the painting may have been
	commissioned by the butchers' guild (&quot;beccai&quot;) to decorate
	its headquarters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">What is certain
is that the painting, also known as the <i>Great Butcher's Shop ,
</i>passed from the Gonzaga family collection to the King of England
<b>Charles I Stuart </b>in <b>1627 </b>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">When we talk
about &quot;two paintings of the butcher's shop&quot;, we often refer
to the two famous versions painted by <b>Annibale Carracci
</b>(1560-1609):</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🎨 <b>The
	&quot;Great Butcher's Shop&quot; (or </b><i><b>Butcher's Shop </b></i><b>)</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Author:
		</b>Annibale Carracci</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Period:
		</b>circa 1585</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Dimensions:
		</b>The largest (approximately 190 x 271 cm)</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Where is
