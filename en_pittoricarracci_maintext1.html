</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Via <b>Riva di
Reno </b>in Bologna covers the underground route of the <b>Reno Canal
</b>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Here are some
important details:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Reno
	Canal: </b>One of Bologna's main man-made canals, it originates from
	the Reno River near the Casalecchio Lock. This canal has been vital
	to the city's economy since the Middle Ages, powering mills, silk
	mills, and other industrial activities.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	Covering: </b>The canal in that section (and in much of the historic
	center) was progressively covered, or &quot;tombato&quot;, starting
	from the mid-twentieth century for traffic and urban redevelopment
	needs, thus creating space for the current road.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Name:
	</b>The name of the street itself (&quot;Riva di Reno&quot;) recalls
	its original function as the bank or shore of the canal.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Current
	Curiosity: </b>In recent years, during the works for the new tram
	line, the rediscovery of some short stretches of the Reno Canal has
	been discussed and is in part being realised</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The road covers
the route of what was once an important open-air waterway.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">From the
14th-century walls surrounding the city , at Via Sabotino, we find
the Grada Church, which covers the Reno Canal. The grate that once
served to stop floating objects entering the city from the canal can
still be seen today. The bodies of people who drowned in the canal
have also been found.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Continuing from
Via della Grada to the intersection with Via San Felice, the road
takes the name of Via di Riva Reno and ends in Piazza della Pioggia,</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">When walking
along Via di Riva Reno, you arrive near the Piazzetta della Pioggia,
at the height of Via Galliera and if you look up at the buildings,
you will see that they are separated by the presence of the canal,
while at the height of the street there is the portico with the
Pioggia butcher's shop which belonged to the Carracci family, in
particular to Ludovico's father, who was a butcher.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis
played a key role in the history of art, marking the transition from
Mannerism to Baroque and founding the famous Bolognese school of
painting.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis had
an enormous impact, not only for their painting, but also for having
created an educational model (the Academy) that trained the major
artists of seventeenth-century Bologna, such as Guido Reni and
Domenichino.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carracci
family, active in Bologna between the late 16th and early 17th
centuries, are crucial figures in the history of Italian art, as they
marked the transition from <b>Mannerism </b>to <b>Baroque </b>and
founded the famous Bolognese school of painting.</p>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🎨 <b>The
Protagonists: The Carracci Cousins</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The group was
composed of three artists, linked by family ties and a revolutionary
artistic vision:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Ludovico
	Carracci </b>(1555–1619): The elder cousin, considered the
	initiator of the artistic reform and the spiritual leader of the
	group.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Agostino
	Carracci </b>(1557–1602): Brother of Annibale, he excelled as <b>an
	engraver </b>as well as a painter, and was the most erudite
	theoretician of the group.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Annibale
	Carracci </b>(1560–1609): Considered the most talented of the
	three, he was a versatile master, excelling in every pictorial
	genre.</p></li>
</ol>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🏛️ <b>The
Academy of the Incamminati</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The most
innovative contribution of the Carraccis was not only their painting,
but the foundation, around <b>1582 </b>, of an artistic workshop that
later became known as <b>the Accademia degli Incamminati </b>(or
<i>Accademia del Naturale </i>or <i>dei Desiderosi </i>).</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Purpose:
	</b>To overcome the formal excesses and artificiality of Mannerism.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Teaching
	Method: </b>The Academy introduced a modern teaching method based
	on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Life
		study </b>( drawing of nude models and anatomy).</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Copying the
		<b>great masters </b>of the Renaissance (such as Raphael, Titian
		and Correggio).</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Discussions
		of art theory, literature, and poetry.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Legacy:
	</b>They trained the major artists of the seventeenth-century
	Bolognese school, including <b>Guido Reni </b>and <b>Domenichino </b>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🖼️ <b>The
Artistic Reform and Style</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis
advocated a &quot;return to nature&quot; and a <b>clearer, more
emotional and accessible painting </b>, anticipating the principles
of Counter-Reformation art.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Historical
	and Religious Painting: </b>Their religious and mythological works
	are characterized by a strong <b>naturalism </b>and a composition
	that combines the balance of the classical tradition (Raphael) with
	the <b>colorism </b>and sensitivity of Venetian light (Titian and
	Correggio).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Frescoes
	of Palazzo Farnese (Rome): </b>Annibale Carracci's masterpiece (with
	the help of Agostino) was the decoration of the <b>Galleria Farnese
	</b>in Rome (1597-1608), which became the model for Roman Baroque
	painting and the mythological fresco of the following centuries.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Genre
	Painting: </b>Annibale Carracci was also a pioneer in <b>genre
	painting </b>, elevating scenes of everyday life (such as <i>The
	Bean Eater </i>or the two versions of <i>The Butcher's Shop </i>) to
	subjects of great artistic dignity through a careful realism free
	from excessive idealization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The famous work
known as <b>&quot;The Butcher's Shop&quot; </b>was painted by
<b>Annibale Carracci </b>(1560–1609).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">It is one of his
most important <b>genre paintings </b>, that is, scenes depicting
moments of everyday life. This work in particular is remarkable
because, despite depicting a humble subject, it does so with great
dignity, realism, and a complex, monumental composition.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Annibale is cited
as an artist who also excelled in genre painting, citing <i>The Bean
Eater </i>as an example of this realism. &quot;The Butcher's Shop&quot;
is another splendid example of this sensibility.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">It is a bit of a
mystery, since the circumstances of its construction, dated around
<b>1585 , are not known with certainty </b>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">There are several
hypotheses about the clients:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Canobi
	Family : </b>One hypothesis is that the work was intended for a
	well-known Bolognese family of wealthy meat traders, the <b>Canobi </b>,
	owners of a large butcher's shop in the city. However, archival
	research has not provided definitive proof.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Butchers'
	Guild: </b>Another theory is that the painting may have been
	commissioned by the butchers' guild (&quot;beccai&quot;) to decorate
	its headquarters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">What is certain
is that the painting, also known as the <i>Great Butcher's Shop ,
</i>passed from the Gonzaga family collection to the King of England
<b>Charles I Stuart </b>in <b>1627 </b>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">When we talk
about &quot;two paintings of the butcher's shop&quot;, we often refer
to the two famous versions painted by <b>Annibale Carracci
</b>(1560-1609):</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🎨 <b>The

<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Both works are
considered fundamental examples of genre painting (scenes of everyday
life) in late sixteenth-century Italian art.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Carracci:
The Fathers of the Baroque in Bologna</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis
were a family of Bolognese artists composed of three central figures:
<b>Ludovico Carracci </b>(1555–1619), his cousin <b>Agostino
Carracci </b>(1557–1602), and Agostino's brother, <b>Annibale
Carracci </b>(1560–1609).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Their work and
artistic philosophy are considered the foundation of Baroque
painting, as they proposed a stylistic &quot;reform&quot; that
overcame the artificiality of Mannerism to return to a vigorous
naturalism and a revival of the great classical models of the
Renaissance (such as Raphael and Titian).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>1. The
Foundation of the Academy of the Incamminati</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The Carraccis'
most revolutionary contribution was the foundation in Bologna, around
1582, of a private school that took the name of <b>Accademia dei
Desiderosi </b>, later renamed <b>Accademia degli Incamminati </b>(that
is, &quot;those who are on the right path of art&quot;).</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This academy is
considered the first modern art institution in Italy for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Study of
	Life: </b>He encouraged the direct study of nature and the human
	body (the &quot;Life Drawing&quot;), breaking with the Mannerist
	practice of copying only the models of previous masters.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Complete
	Education : </b>In addition to drawing and painting, the Academy
	offered lessons in anatomy, geometry, perspective, and literature,
	elevating the artist from a mere craftsman to a complete
	intellectual.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Stylistic
	Summary : </b>The Carraccis taught how to combine the rigorous
	<b>drawing </b>of the Tuscan-Roman tradition (Michelangelo, Raphael)
	with the <b>colour </b>and use of light typical of the Venetian
	school (Titian, Correggio).</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>2. The Main
Works</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The three
Carraccis worked closely together for many years, often making it
difficult to distinguish individual hands in the early fresco cycles
in Bologna:</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Bologna Period
(Collaboration)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Palazzo
	Fava, Bologna </b>(1584): Frescoes with the <i>Stories of Jason and
	Medea </i>and the <i>Stories of Aeneas </i>.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Palazzo
	Magnani, Bologna </b>(1589-1592): The famous frieze depicting the
	<i>Foundation of Rome </i>, a masterpiece of narrative clarity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Maturity in
Rome (Hannibal)</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In 1595, Annibale
and Agostino were summoned to Rome by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese.
Annibale in particular produced the work that would become the
manifesto of Baroque classicism:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Farnese
	Gallery , Rome </b>(1597-1601): The frescoes depicting <i>The Loves
	of the Gods </i>. This cycle is considered a masterpiece of
	monumental fresco painting and was a point of reference for entire
	generations of subsequent artists, including Lanfranco and Pietro da
	Cortona.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>3. The Three
Artists</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Annibale
	Carracci (1560-1609): </b>The most gifted and innovative of the
	trio. He excelled in both large-scale mythological frescoes (as in
	the Palazzo Farnese) and genre painting (such as <i>The Bean Eater
	</i>), displaying a realism and sensitivity to everyday life that
	anticipated the work of Caravaggio. He is buried in the Pantheon
	next to Raphael.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Ludovico
	Carracci (1555-1619): </b>The eldest and the intellectual and
	theoretical leader of the group. He remained mainly in Bologna,
	focusing primarily on religious works of the Counter-Reformation,
	characterized by profound devotion and emotional intensity.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Agostino
	Carracci (1557-1602): </b>A versatile artist, also known as an
	engraver and theorist. He collaborated actively with his brother and
	cousin, contributing significantly to the decorations of Bologna and
	Rome.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This house was
already owned by Giovanni Maria Carracci in 1563, who, coming from
Cremona, had opened a <i><b>butcher 's shop in Bologna </b></i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Carracci was the
founder of the Carracci family, which produced two generations of
painters who lived and opened workshops in this very building for
over half a century.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The emotional
bond that the Carraccis had for this home of theirs is demonstrated
by the fact that, even when fame took them to work elsewhere, this
place remained a point of reference to which they always returned.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">On 14 December
1619, in this palace where he was born and which still belonged to
Paolo Carracci, son of Vincenzo, also known as a painter, Ludovico,
the most famous artist of the family, died whose remains were later
buried in the church of S. Maria Maggiore di Galliera.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Over the
centuries, the factory underwent heavy renovations and only recently
underwent a renovation that erased all the damage suffered during the
war. These works have brought to light precious traces of the
building's past.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The portal has a
splayed lintel and its width, given the characteristics of the
street, is still unusual.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The double door
is made of solid wood. It is a fine example of cabinetmaking and
originally had a pedestrian door, which has now been fixed and
concealed with moldings. The handles are polished brass.</p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🥩 <b>Meaning
of &quot;Beccaro&quot;</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">&quot;Beccaro&quot;
is a term of ancient dialectal origin (especially <b>Lombard </b>and
<b>Northern Italian </b>) which means:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Butcher
	</b>(the most common meaning).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Butcher
	</b>(synonym of butcher, although it sometimes indicated the breeder
	of cattle destined for slaughter).</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In short, it
indicated the person who slaughtered animals or sold meat for a
living.</p>


<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🌎 <b>Origin
and Etymology</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The origin of the
word &quot; beccaro &quot; is of a <b>professional nature </b>and is
linked to the trade described above.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">It derives
	from the word <b>&quot;becco&quot; </b>which, in Latin ( <i>beccus
	</i>), can mean &quot;beak&quot; (of the bird), but in the butcher's
	context refers to the <b>male goat </b>or, more generally, to
	cattle.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">One of the
	most popular hypotheses is that the term is linked to the meat of
	<b>goat </b>(beak) or farmyard animals, which was very popular in
	the Middle Ages.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The form <b>&quot;
	beccaro &quot; </b>is considered the ancestor or dialectal form
	(ancient or regional) of the modern Italian <b>&quot;beccaio&quot; .</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">This term, like
many medieval trade names, is at the origin of numerous Italian
surnames such as <b>Beccari </b>, <b>Beccaro </b>and the illustrious
<b>Beccaria </b>(for example, Cesare Beccaria, the author of <i>Dei
delitti e delle pene </i>).</p>
