<p> The plague that struck Bologna in 1630 was a dramatic event, part of a larger epidemic that devastated Northern Italy, also known as the Manzonian plague.</p> <p>Here are the main points:</p> <p><b>Spread </b>: The epidemic was brought to Bologna in May 1630 by Landsknecht soldiers, who had arrived to besiege Mantua during the War of the Mantuan Succession. <br/> Despite the efforts of Cardinal Legate Bernardino Spada and the Bolognese Senate to keep the contagion outside the walls, the disease spread.</p> <p><b>Casualties </b>: It was a catastrophic event for the city's demographics. In the city, 13,398 victims were recorded between May and December 1630, out of a population of approximately 61,559 inhabitants in the urban center. <br/> In the surrounding countryside, the victims numbered approximately 16,300. In total, it is estimated that Bologna and its surrounding countryside lost approximately 40,000 people.</p> <p><b>Emergency management </b>: The fight against the epidemic was directed by Cardinal Bernardino Spada, who availed himself of the work of the Camillian religious to assist the plague victims. &lt; <br/> Lazarettos were set up outside Porta Santo Stefano and in Castelfranco.</p> <p><b>Consequences </b>: The city, already suffering from the famines of the early century, lost nearly half its population. The epidemic had serious social consequences.</p> <p><b>Art and Memory </b>: In memory and thanksgiving for the end of the plague, the famous Plague Altarpiece (or "Altarpiece of the Virgin and the patron saints of Bologna who intercede for the city") was commissioned from Guido Reni in 1630. A precious votive canopy was also created.</p> <p><img align="bottom" border="0" height="287" name="Immagine 2" src="en-graziaxx_html_fd5423b9.jpg" width="315"/> </p> <p><b>Primary Sources (Originals of the time):</b></p> <ol> <li><p><b>Official and Administrative Documentation:</b></p> <ul> <li><p><b>Proclamations and Decrees of the Assunteria di Sanità and the Bolognese Senate </b>(starting in 1628, regarding the management of the contagion, the measures adopted, and the organization of services).
