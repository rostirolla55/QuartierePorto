The Church of San Benedetto in Bologna, located in Via Indipendenza,
has a long and complex history:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Origins: </b>Its origins
	date back to the <b>13th century </b>(some documents mention it as a
	parish as early as 1202). It was initially located just outside
	Bologna's second city walls.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>17th-century reconstruction:
	</b>It was <b>completely rebuilt in 1606 </b>based on a design by
	<b>Giovanni Battista Ballerini </b>. At that time, it was officiated
	by the Minim Friars of San Francesco di Paola (known as &quot;paolotti&quot;),
	to whom it had been assigned in 1529.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Original Orientation: </b>Until
	the end of the nineteenth century, the church overlooked <b>Via
	Galliera </b>, where the ancient façade (later redone in 1932)
	flanked by the bell tower is still visible today.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The opening of Via
	Indipendenza: </b>The major transformation took place in <b>1892
	</b>with the opening of the new <b>Via dell'Indipendenza </b>. To
	adapt to the new layout and the new road, the orientation of the
	church was <b>reversed </b>: the apse became the new façade, which
	was rebuilt with the addition of a portico.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Interior: </b>Despite the
	external transformations, the interior preserves important works by
	artists who were protagonists of the Bolognese Mannerism and Baroque
	periods, including paintings by <b>Giacomo Cavedoni </b>, <b>Alessandro
	Tiarini </b>and <b>Lucio Massari </b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In short, the current appearance of
the church is the result of the seventeenth-century reconstruction
and the radical reorientation at the end of the nineteenth century,
when it was &quot;turned&quot; to face the modern Via Indipendenza.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Historical Sources for the Church
of San Benedetto</b></p>

	Urban History of Bologna:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Archives and Studies on the
		History of Via Indipendenza: </b>These documents (often linked to
		the State Archives or the Archiginnasio Library) are crucial for
		precisely dating the great transformation of <b>1892 </b>, the year
		in which the church was <b>&quot;turned&quot; </b>and the facade
		reoriented to face the newly created Via Indipendenza.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Studies on the Bolognese
		Churches: </b>Academic texts and monographs which attest to their
		<b>origins in the 13th century </b>and the subsequent <b>17th
		century reconstruction </b>(dated <b>1606 </b>), specifying the
		role of the architect <b>Giovanni Battista Ballerini </b>.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Sources of the History of
	Art and Architecture of Bologna:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Art Guides and Catalogs:
		</b>For a list of the interior works and artists. These sources
		confirm the presence of paintings by Baroque and Mannerist masters,
		such as <b>Giacomo Cavedoni </b>, <b>Alessandro Tiarini </b>, and
		<b>Lucio Massari </b>.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Texts on Religious

		<b>Minim Friars of San Francesco di Paola </b>(the &quot;Paolotti&quot;).</p></li>

		Culture Portals of the Municipality of Bologna (e.g. </b><i><b>Bologna
		Welcome </b></i><b>or </b><i><b>History and Memory of Bologna </b></i><b>):
		</b>These sites summarize and validate key historical data (13th
		century, 17th-century reconstruction, late 19th-century
		reorientation) for public use.</p></li>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In summary, the information comes
from a concordance of data present in historical archives, art
history studies, and institutional sources that trace the evolution
of this important Bolognese place of worship.</p>
