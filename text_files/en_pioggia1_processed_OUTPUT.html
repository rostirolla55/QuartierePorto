Mattioli, a Bolognese artist active between the late 17th and early 18th centuries, was known not only for his canvases but also as <b>an engraver </b>and <b>landscape painter </b>.</p></li> <li><p><b>Style: </b>His landscapes are typical of the late Baroque and Rococo style. Unlike Annibale's solemn and "heroic" nature, Mattioli's works present a more <b>painterly </b>, <b>airy </b>, and less structured style, with a predilection for atmosphere and light effects.</p></li> <li><p><b>The Church: </b>The Sanctuary of the Madonna della Pioggia (or San Bartolomeo di Reno) has undergone numerous renovations over the centuries. The current church is mostly from the <b>18th century </b>(rebuilt according to a design attributed to Alfonso Torreggiani), and works such as that by Mattioli fit into this 18th-century decorative context.</p></li> <li><p><b>Iconography: </b>The inclusion of St. Bartholomew, the martyred apostle, serves as a reference to the ancient dedication of the church and the adjoining hospice.</p></li> </ul> <p><br/> <br/> </p>
