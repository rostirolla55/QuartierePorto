<p>Links and Additional Content (Photos)</p>
<p>For photos, the best way is to consult online resources that document the historic building and the restoration projects:</p>
<p>Ex Reale Manifattura dei Tabacchi - Bologna Online : Often contains historical or current images of the building and its Art Nouveau facade.</p>
<p>Manifattura Tabacchi - History and Memory of Bologna : Another resource that documents the history and appearance of the place.</p>
<p>I particularly recommend that you look for images of the facade on Via Riva di Reno , which is the best preserved and most characteristic part of the Art Nouveau architecture.</p>
<p>If you're specifically interested in photographs taken inside abandoned areas before their redevelopment (often with an industrial archaeology feel), you should look for exhibitions or projects like the one mentioned in the article: "Spazi vicini. Ex Manifattura Tabacchi. Percorso fotografico verso il recupero" by Ivano Adversi .</p>
