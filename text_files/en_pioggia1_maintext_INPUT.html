The <b>Sanctuary of the Madonna della Pioggia and of San Bartolomeo
di Reno </b>(Via Riva di Reno, 124, corner of Via Galliera) in
Bologna, houses the &quot;Landscape with Bartolomeo&quot; which is a
work by the Bolognese painter <b>Ludovico Mattioli </b>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🖼️ <b>Ludovico Mattioli's
&quot;Landscape with Saint Bartholomew&quot;</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The work mentioned is located along
the staircase leading to the upper rooms of the church and is not a
painting by Annibale, as it is erroneously attributed to him, but by
one of his successors from the Bolognese school.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Historical and Artistic Context:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Landscape in the 18th
	Century: </b>Although Annibale Carracci pioneered the &quot;ideal
	landscape&quot; in the 17th century, Ludovico Mattioli worked in a
	later era, the 18th century, when the landscape genre was fully
	developed and independent. Mattioli, a Bolognese artist active
	between the late 17th and early 18th centuries, was known not only
	for his canvases but also as <b>an engraver </b>and <b>landscape
	painter </b>.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Style: </b>His landscapes
	are typical of the late Baroque and Rococo style. Unlike Annibale's
	solemn and &quot;heroic&quot; nature, Mattioli's works present a
	more <b>painterly </b>, <b>airy </b>, and less structured style,
	with a predilection for atmosphere and light effects.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Church: </b>The
	Sanctuary of the Madonna della Pioggia (or San Bartolomeo di Reno)
	has undergone numerous renovations over the centuries. The current
	church is mostly from the <b>18th century </b>(rebuilt according to
	a design attributed to Alfonso Torreggiani), and works such as that
	by Mattioli fit into this 18th-century decorative context.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Iconography: </b>The
	inclusion of St. Bartholomew, the martyred apostle, serves as a
	reference to the ancient dedication of the church and the adjoining
	hospice.</p></li>
