<p> There was a street in Bologna called <b>Pugliole di San Bernardino </b>. This street disappeared following the urban planning interventions of the 1930s which led to the creation of Via Guglielmo Marconi (then Via Roma).</p> <p>The "Pugliole di San Bernardino" took their name from the Monastery or Convent of San Bernardino which was located in the area of the current Piazza dei Martiri 1943-1945. The street branched off from Borgo Polese (the current Via Polese) and wound its way up to Via del Porto, partly following the current route of Via Marconi.</p> <p>The term "Pugliola" (or, in the plural, "Pugliole") is an ancient term in Bolognese toponymy. It refers to an alley, a narrow street, or a small group of houses. It generally indicated a small road or a secondary residential area, often resulting from an ancient subdivision of the urban fabric.</p> <p>Many streets and alleys in Bologna, such as "Pugliole di San Bernardino" or "Pugliole dello Spirito Santo," were named after nearby churches or monasteries, combining the name of the religious institution with the term "pugliola" to indicate the adjacent alley.</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p>
