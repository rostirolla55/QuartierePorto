The plague that struck Bologna in 1630 was a dramatic event, part of
a larger epidemic that devastated Northern Italy, also known as the
Manzonian plague.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Here are the main points:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Spread </b>: The epidemic was
brought to Bologna in May 1630 by Landsknecht soldiers, who had
arrived to besiege Mantua during the War of the Mantuan Succession.
<br/>
Despite the efforts of Cardinal Legate Bernardino Spada and the
Bolognese Senate to keep the contagion outside the walls, the disease
spread.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Casualties </b>: It was a
catastrophic event for the city's demographics. In the city, 13,398
victims were recorded between May and December 1630, out of a
population of approximately 61,559 inhabitants in the urban center.
<br/>
In the surrounding countryside, the victims numbered
approximately 16,300. In total, it is estimated that Bologna and its
surrounding countryside lost approximately 40,000 people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Emergency management </b>: The
fight against the epidemic was directed by Cardinal Bernardino Spada,
who availed himself of the work of the Camillian religious to assist
the plague victims. &lt; <br/>
Lazarettos were set up outside Porta
Santo Stefano and in Castelfranco.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Consequences </b>: The city,
already suffering from the famines of the early century, lost nearly
half its population. The epidemic had serious social consequences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Art and Memory </b>: In memory
and thanksgiving for the end of the plague, the famous Plague
Altarpiece (or &quot;Altarpiece of the Virgin and the patron saints
of Bologna who intercede for the city&quot;) was commissioned from
Guido Reni in 1630. A precious votive canopy was also created.</p>
