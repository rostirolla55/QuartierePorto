<p> In Bologna, you'll find sandstone slabs in various streets of the historic center that aren't just decorative, but also have a very interesting historical significance. These are the city's oldest house numbers. They were introduced in the late 18th century, when Bologna was under Napoleonic rule, to better organize the postal service and city administration.</p> <p>Before then, houses didn't have numbers, and people sometimes oriented themselves by the description of the facade or the name of the family who lived there. The sandstone tiles, which you still find today, are a testament to this change. Many of those you see are terracotta and were made over the centuries, sometimes replacing the original ones. While terracotta tiles were easier to mass-produce, the engraving on the stone was a handcrafted work that demonstrates the importance and durability these urban landmarks were intended to provide.</p> <p>The presence of these sandstone numbers is a tangible testimony to the evolution of the city and the traditional materials used over the centuries.</p> <p>At number 11 on Via Tanari Vecchia we find a sandstone plaque bearing the number 1202 (an even number), while the current number is 11 (an odd number), being on the right in the direction of increasing numbers, as required by current toponymic regulations.</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p>
