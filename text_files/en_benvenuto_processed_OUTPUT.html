<h1>Titolo mancante</h1>
<!-- Contenuto Principale -->
<p> Welcome to the website about Bologna. <br/> I'll accompany you with audio, and for more details, you can read the text and images on the page. <br/> I'll take you back in time based on the place you stop. <br/> If you find a QR code at the location, you can access a page directly. <br/> If you don't have a QR code, activate your smartphone's GPS. At the top right, you'll find a green rectangular button that will list nearby places of interest. <br/> Selecting an item from the list will open the corresponding page. At the top left, there are three horizontal lines that provide a complete list of places documented on the site.</p>
