<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">🖼️ <b>Ludovico
Mattioli's &quot;Landscape with Saint Bartholomew&quot;</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The work
mentioned is located along the staircase leading to the upper rooms
of the church and is not a painting by Annibale, as it is erroneously
attributed to him, but by one of his successors from the Bolognese
school.</p>

Artistic Context:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Landscape
	in the 18th Century: </b>Although Annibale Carracci pioneered the
	&quot;ideal landscape&quot; in the 17th century, Ludovico Mattioli
	worked in a later era, the 18th century, when the landscape genre
	was fully developed and independent. Mattioli, a Bolognese artist
	active between the late 17th and early 18th centuries, was known not
	only for his canvases but also as an <b>engraver </b>and <b>landscape
	painter </b>.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Style:
	</b>His landscapes are typical of the late Baroque and Rococo style.
	Unlike Annibale's solemn and &quot;heroic&quot; nature, Mattioli's
	works present a more <b>painterly </b>, <b>airy </b>, and less
	structured style, with a predilection for atmosphere and light
	effects.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	Church: </b>The Sanctuary of the Madonna della Pioggia (or San
	Bartolomeo di Reno) has undergone numerous renovations over the
	centuries. The current church is mostly from the <b>18th century
	</b>(rebuilt according to a design attributed to Alfonso
	Torreggiani), and works such as that by Mattioli fit into this
	18th-century decorative context.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Iconography:
	</b>The inclusion of St. Bartholomew, the martyred apostle, serves
	as a reference to the ancient dedication of the church and the
	adjoining hospice.</p></li>
