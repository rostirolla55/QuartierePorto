In Bologna, you'll find sandstone slabs in various streets of the
historic center that aren't just decorative, but also have a very
interesting historical significance. These are the city's oldest
house numbers. They were introduced in the late 18th century, when
Bologna was under Napoleonic rule, to better organize the postal
service and city administration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Before then, houses didn't have
numbers, and people sometimes oriented themselves by the description
of the facade or the name of the family who lived there. The
sandstone tiles, which you still find today, are a testament to this
change. Many of those you see are terracotta and were made over the
centuries, sometimes replacing the original ones. While terracotta
tiles were easier to mass-produce, the engraving on the stone was a
handcrafted work that demonstrates the importance and durability
these urban landmarks were intended to provide.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The presence of these sandstone
numbers is a tangible testimony to the evolution of the city and the
traditional materials used over the centuries.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm">At number 11 on Via Tanari Vecchia
we find a sandstone plaque bearing the number 1202 (an even number),
while the current number is 11 (an odd number), being on the right in
the direction of increasing numbers, as required by current toponymic
regulations.</p>
