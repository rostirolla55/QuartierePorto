Welcome to the site about Bologna. <br/>
I'll accompany you with
audio, and for more details, you can read the text and images on the
page. I'll take you back in time based on the place you stop. If you
find a QR code at the location, you can access a page directly. If
you don't have a QR code, activate your smartphone's GPS. In the top
right, you'll find a green rectangular button that will list nearby
places of interest. Selecting an item from the list will open the
corresponding page. In the top left, there are three horizontal lines
that provide a complete list of the places documented on the site.</p>
