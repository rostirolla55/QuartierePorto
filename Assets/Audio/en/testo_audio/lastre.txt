Bologna Unveiled: When a House Number Tells a Story

Walking through Bologna's historic center, your eyes will encounter simple sandstone slabs. They're more than just decorations: they're the city's oldest house numbers, a silent legacy of the Napoleonic era.

Introduced in the late 18th century to impose order and modernize services like the postal service, these stone plaques marked a revolution. Before then, orientation was based on descriptions of facades or the name of the resident family—a chaos that the new regime swept away.

While many subsequent plaques were made of terracotta for mass production, the sandstone engraving is evidence of a craftsmanship destined to endure. Today, these house numbers are more than just street signs, but true urban fossils that demonstrate the evolution of materials and city management.

A fascinating detail? On Via Tanari Vecchia, the ancient sandstone slab bears the number 1202, but the current street number is 11, revealing centuries of toponymic reorganizations right beneath our feet. Each slab is a tangible trace of the past living in the present.
