Cavaticcio Canal and the Ancient Port</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">The name of the
power plant derives from the <b>Cavaticcio Canal </b>, a short but
crucial canal in the Bologna hydraulic system:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Route:
	</b>The Cavaticcio branches off from the Reno Canal under Via Riva
	di Reno and, after the waterfall that feeds the power plant, reaches
	the area of the ancient port (now Largo Caduti del Lavoro, near the
	Salara), to then continue under the name of <b>Canale Navile </b>,
	which was the waterway for the transport of goods towards the
	north-east.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>History
	of the Canal: </b>Until the 1930s, much of the Cavaticcio was
	uncovered. Subsequently, it was gradually <b>filled in </b>for urban
	planning reasons, particularly during construction work to open Via
	Roma (now Via Marconi).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The Port:
	</b>The area where the power plant is located today, between the
	Salara and the current Cavaticcio Park, was the ancient <b>Port of
	Bologna </b>, the terminal point of the Navile Canal.</p></li>
</ul>

	and Ownership: </b>The work was carried out by the Municipality of
	Bologna and is currently owned and managed by the <b>Consortium of
	the Casalecchio Dam and the Reno Canal </b>.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Revamping:
	</b>The plant has undergone major restoration <b>and modernization
	(revamping) </b>in recent years, to bring it up to the most modern
	technological standards and maximize clean energy production.</p></li>
